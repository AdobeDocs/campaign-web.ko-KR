Adobe Campaign v8은 이메일, 푸시 알림, SMS, 다이렉트 메일 등 다양한 마케팅 채널을 위해 구축된 차세대 캠페인 도구입니다. 완벽한 캠페인을 제작 및 큐레이션하는 데 도움이 되는 강력한 ETL 및 데이터 관리 기능을 제공합니다. 오케스트레이션 엔진은 배치 기반 여정을 핵심으로 집중하는 풍부한 멀티 터치 마케팅 프로그램을 제공합니다. 또한 암호 재설정, 주문 확인, 전자 수신 등 커뮤니케이션의 전반을 포함하는 페이로드를 기반으로, 마케팅 팀이 사전 정의된 메시지를 모든 IT 시스템에서 전송할 수 있도록 지원하는 확장 가능한 실시간 메시징 서버도 제공합니다.

Campaign을 사용하여 다음과 같은 작업을 수행할 수 있습니다.

* 고객에 대한 접근성 높은 단일 관점을 통한 개인화 및 참여 **촉진**
* 이메일, 모바일, 온라인 및 오프라인 채널을 고객 여정에 **통합**
* 의미 있고 시의적절한 메시지 및 오퍼 게재 **자동화**

## Campaign Web 사용자 인터페이스 살펴보기 {#web}

초기에는 리치 [클라이언트 콘솔](#ac-client)을 통해서만 사용할 수 있었던 Campaign은 이제 개선된 사용 가능성, 접근성 및 새로운 디자인을 갖춘 새로운 웹 사용자 인터페이스(UI)를 제공하여 사용자 경험을 크게 향상시킵니다. 이 새로운 최신 UI에서는 Adobe Experience Platform을 비롯한 다른 Adobe 솔루션과 함께 마케팅 캠페인 디자인 및 게재를 간소화하고 일관성을 제공합니다.

![](assets/home.png){zoomable="yes"}

이 새로운 웹 사용자 인터페이스는 먼저 **비즈니스 전문가**&#x200B;의 요구 사항을 충족합니다. 이 첫 번째 버전에서는 일부 일반 관리 작업을 사용할 수 없지만 후속 버전에서 이러한 문제가 해결될 것입니다. 현재 클라이언트 콘솔에서 사용할 수 있는 단일 기능 또는 옵션 중 일부는 새 UI에서는 사용할 수 없습니다. 새 사용 사례, 옵션 및 기능은 향후 릴리스에서 사용할 수 있습니다.

관리자 또는 전문가가 Campaign Web 사용자 인터페이스에서 사용할 수 없는 Campaign v8 기능이 필요한 경우 [클라이언트 콘솔](#ac-client)에 연결할 수 있습니다.

[이 페이지](connect-to-campaign.md)에서는 Adobe Campaign Web 버전에 연결하는 방법을 알아봅니다.

## Campaign 클라이언트 콘솔 정보 {#ac-client}

클라이언트 콘솔은 관리자와 고급 사용자가 작업을 수행할 수 있도록 설계되었습니다. Campaign 클라이언트 콘솔은 시스템에 설치된 브라우저 기반 애플리케이션입니다. 웹 서비스 API를 사용하여 Campaign 애플리케이션 서버에 연결합니다.

Campaign 데이터는 애플리케이션 서버에 저장됩니다. 클라이언트 콘솔과 Campaign Web 사용자 인터페이스 모두에서 데이터를 사용할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어 클라이언트 콘솔을 사용하여 게재 템플릿을 만들면 이 템플릿을 Campaign Web 사용자 인터페이스에서도 사용할 수 있습니다. 또한 Campaign Web 사용자 인터페이스에서 이메일 게재를 생성하는 경우 클라이언트 콘솔에서도 이 게재에 액세스할 수 있습니다.

일부 오브젝트는 클라이언트 콘솔에서만 만들고 관리할 수 있습니다. 오브젝트는 Campaign Web 사용자 인터페이스에서 보고 사용할 수 있지만, 이 환경에서는 만들거나 수정할 수 없습니다. 모든 Campaign 오브젝트와 구성 요소는 탐색기 보기와 왼쪽 탐색 메뉴에서 사용할 수 있습니다.

클라이언트 콘솔로 Campaign v8을 사용하는 자세한 방법은 [Campaign v8(클라이언트 콘솔) 설명서](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/campaign-home.html?lang=ko){target="_blank"}를 참조하십시오.

    You can access to Adobe Campaign via its client console or its Web user interface. You can also use APIs to manage data and perform tasks in your Campaign platform.

**Understand Campaign general architecture**

Learn about the typical Adobe Campaign solution deployment.

Adobe Campaign is a cross channel marketing solution that automates email, mobile, social and offline campaigns. Adobe Campaign provides a central place to access your customer data and profiles. Use Adobe Campaign to orchestrate consistent experiences to your customers, design, execute, and personalize your marketing across channels, while improving customer experiences on every device and touchpoint.

**Administrate environment**

* **Connect to your environment(s)** -  Once the client console is installed, follow the steps in this documentation to create the connection to the application server.

* **Define permissions** - Adobe Campaign lets you define and manage the rights assigned to users. These permissions are defined by combining operator group permissions, named rights and permissions on folders.

* **Use Campaign control panel** - The Adobe Campaign Control Panel allows Adobe Campaign administrators to monitor key assets and perform administrative tasks, such as managing the SFTP storage by instance, managing GPG keys, or subdomains and certificates.

    Control Panel allows you to set up new connections to your instances by adding IP addresses ranges to the allow list.
    Subdomain configuration allows you to configure a sub-section of your domain (technically a "DNS zone") for use with Adobe Campaign.
    In the Control Panel, you can interact with all SFTP servers that are connected to Campaign instances that you have access to.

* **Use the audit trail** - In Adobe Campaign Web User Interface, the Audit trail feature provides users with full visibility into all modifications made to important entities within your instance, typically those that significantly impact a smooth operation of the instance.

**Set up user interface**

* **Customize campaign UI** - Guidelines for managing user interface settings like lists, units, or data display.

* **Add custom fields** - Custom fields are additional attributes added to the out-of-the-box schemas through the Adobe Campaign console. These custom fields are displayed in various screens, for example the details of a profile or a test profile.

**Set up the branding**

Every company has brand guidelines that define both visual elements and technical details. Adobe Campaign helps you manage these guidelines centrally, so you can present a consistent brand image to your customers in everything you do, from logos in emails to the URLs and domains used in your campaigns.

**Understand data model creation**

Adobe Campaign comes with a pre-defined data model. This section gives some details on the built-in tables of the Adobe Campaign data model and their interaction. Adobe Campaign relies on a Cloud database containing tables that are linked together.

A schema is an XML document associated with a database table. It defines data structure and describes the SQL definition of the table.
When you create or extend a schema, you need to create or modify the associated input forms to make those changes visible to end-users.
An input form lets you edit an instance associated with a data schema from the Adobe Campaign client console. The form is identified by its name and namespace.

**Understand data management**

Use Adobe Campaign workflows to improve the speed and scale of every aspect of your marketing campaigns, from creating segments and preparing messages to delivery.

Campaign helps you add contacts to the Cloud database. You can load a file, schedule and automate multiple contact updates, collect data on the Web, or enter profile information directly into the recipient table.

You can easily export your different reports to PDF or CSV format, which enables you to share, manipulate, or print them.
Quarantine is the way to manage the invalid addresses in deliveries.

**About delivery management**

Campaign Optimization is the Adobe Campaign module which lets you control, filter and monitor the sending of deliveries. To avoid conflicts between campaigns, Adobe Campaign can test various combinations by applying specific constraint rules. This guarantees that the messages sent meet the needs and expectations of customers and company communication policies.

All marketing campaigns are based on a template, which stores main characteristics and capabilities. Campaign comes with a built-in template to create campaigns. This template has all functionalities enabled: Documents, Seed addresses, Approvals, Delivery outlines, etc.

Learn how to setup and manage subscriptions and target subscribers.

This functionality enables you to standardize the creative look and feel, in order to be quicker in executing and launching campaigns.

* **Content blocks** - Learn how created dynamic content blocks and how to use them to personalize the content of your email delivery.

* **Landing pages** - Once you designed your landing page content, you can save it for future reuse.

* **Content fragments** - A content fragment is a reusable component that can be referenced in one or more messages. When modifying a fragment, every content using it is updated.

* **Triggers** - Each event can trigger a personalized message. For this to happen, you need to create a message template to match each event type. Templates contain the necessary information for personalizing the transactional message.


**Use subscription services**

Use Adobe Campaign Web to manage and create your services such as newsletters, and to check the subscriptions or unsubscriptions to these services.

**Configure delivery sending**

External accounts are used by technical processes such as technical workflows or campaign workflows. For example, when setting up a file transfer in a workflow or a data exchange with any other application (Adobe Target, Experience Manager, etc.), you need to select an external account.


**Manage Adobe Campaign integrations**

You can connect your Campaign environment with Adobe Experience Cloud solutions and apps to combine capabilities.<br/>
